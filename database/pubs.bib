	abstract = {We perform microscopic numerical simulations of the Josephson effect through short junctions between two full-shell hybrid nanowires, comprised of a semiconductor core fully wrapped by a thin superconductor shell, both in the trivial and topological regimes. We explore the behavior of the current-phase relation and the critical current 𝐼𝑐 as a function of a threading flux for different models of the semiconductor core and different transparencies of the weak link. We find that 𝐼𝑐 is modulated with flux due to the Little-Parks (LP) effect and displays a characteristic skewness towards large fluxes within nonzero LP lobes, which is inherited from the skewness of a peculiar kind of subgap states known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analogs. The appearance of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological phase is revealed in 𝐼𝑐 as fin-shaped peaks that stand out from the background at low junction transparencies. The competition between CdGMs of opposite electron- and holelike character produces steps and dips in 𝐼𝑐. A rich phenomenology results, which includes 0-, 𝜋-, and 𝜙-junction behaviors depending on the charge distribution across the wire core and the junction transparency.},

The combination of the quantized fluxoid of the shell and the Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor interface gives rise to analogs of Caroli–de Gennes–Matricon states found in Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Unlike in metallic superconductors, Caroli–de Gennes–Matricon analogs in full-shell hybrid nanowires manifest as one-dimensional Van Hove singularities with energy spacings comparable to the superconducting gap and independent of the Fermi energy, making them readily observable. Evolution of these analogs with axial magnetic field, skewed within the Little-Parks lobe structure, is consistent with theory and yields information about the radial distribution and angular momenta of the corresponding subbands.},

	abstract = {Majorana bound states (MBSs) located at the ends of a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire are only true zero modes if their characteristic localization length is much smaller than the nanowire length, 𝜉𝑀≪𝐿. Otherwise, their wave function overlap gives rise to a finite energy splitting that shows a characteristic oscillatory pattern ∼𝑒−2⁢𝐿/𝜉𝑀⁢cos⁡(𝑘𝐹⁢𝐿) versus external parameters that modify the Fermi momentum 𝑘𝐹. Detecting such “Majorana oscillations,” measurable through low-bias conductance, has been proposed as a strategy for Majorana detection in pristine nanowires. Here we discuss how this detection scheme does not work in full-shell hybrid nanowires, an alternative design to partial-shell nanowires in which a superconductor shell fully wraps the semiconductor core. Using microscopic models, we provide both numerical simulations for Al/InAs hybrids as well as analytical approximations in terms of general nanowire parameters. We find that Majorana oscillations with flux in full-shell nanowires are absent in a wide portion of parameter space. This absence is not a signature of nonoverlapping left- and right-end MBSs, but a consequence of the Majorana oscillation period being systematically larger than the flux window of odd Little-Parks lobes where Majorana zero-energy peaks are predicted to appear. Our results demonstrate that split near-zero modes or individual zero-energy crossings should not be dismissed as trivial even if they are found not to oscillate with flux.},

	abstract = {Full-shell nanowires are hybrid nanostructures consisting of a semiconducting core encapsulated in an epitaxial superconducting shell. When subject to an external magnetic flux, they exhibit the Little-Parks (LP) phenomenon of flux-modulated superconductivity, an effect connected to the physics of Abrikosov vortex lines in type-II superconductors. We show theoretically that full-shell nanowires can host subgap states that are a variant of the Caroli–de Gennes–Matricon (CdGM) states in vortices. These CdGM analogs are shell-induced Van Hove singularities in propagating core subbands. We elucidate their structure, parameter dependence, and behavior in tunneling spectroscopy through a series of models of growing complexity. Using microscopic numerical simulations, we show that CdGM analogs exhibit a characteristic skewness towards higher flux values inside nonzero LP lobes resulting from the interplay of three ingredients. First, the orbital coupling to the field shifts the energy of the CdGM analogs proportionally to the flux and to their generalized angular momentum. Second, CdGM analogs coalesce into degeneracy points at flux values for which their corresponding radial wavefunctions are threaded by an integer multiple of the flux quantum. And third, the average radii of all CdGM-analog wavefunctions inside the core are approximately equal for realistic parameters and are controlled by the electrostatic band bending at the core/shell interface. As the average radius moves away from the interface, the degeneracy points shift towards larger fluxes from the center of the LP lobes, causing the skewness. This analysis provides a transparent interpretation of the nanowire spectrum that allows to extract microscopic information by measuring the number and skewness of CdGM analogs. Moreover, it allows to derive an efficient Hamiltonian of the full-shell nanowire in terms of a modified hollow-core model at the average radius.},

	abstract = {Full-shell nanowires have been proposed as an alternative nanowire design in the search of topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs). They are hybrid nanostructures consisting of a semiconductor core fully covered by a thin superconductor shell and subject to a magnetic flux. Compared to their partial-shell counterparts, full-shell nanowires present some advantages that could help to clearly identify the elusive Majorana quasiparticles, such as the operation at smaller magnetic fields and low or zero semiconductor g factor, and the expected appearance of MZMs at well-controlled regions of parameter space. In this paper we critically examine this proposal, finding a very rich spectral phenomenology that combines the Little-Parks modulation of the parent-gap superconductor with flux, the presence of flux-dispersing Caroli–de Gennes–Matricon (CdGM) analog subgap states, and the emergence of MZMs across finite flux intervals that depend on the transverse wavefunction profile of the charge density in the core section. Through microscopic simulations and analytical derivations, we study different regimes for the semiconductor core, ranging from the hollow-core approximation, to the tubular-core nanowire appropriate for a semiconductor tube with an insulating core, to the solid-core nanowire with the characteristic dome-shaped radial profile for the electrostatic potential inside the semiconductor. We compute the phase diagrams for the different models in cylindrical nanowires and find that MZMs typically coexist with CdGM analogs at zero energy, rendering them gapless. However, we also find topologically protected parameter regions or islands with gapped MZMs. In this sense, the most promising candidate to obtain topologically protected MZMs in a full-shell geometry is the nanowire with a tubular-shaped core. Moving beyond pristine nanowires, we study the effect of mode mixing perturbations. On the one hand, mode mixing can gap CdGM analogs and open minigaps around existing MZMs. On the other hand and rather strikingly, mode mixing can act like a topological p-wave pairing between particle-hole Bogoliubov partners, and is therefore able to create new topologically protected MZMs in regions of the phase diagram that were originally trivial. As a result, the phase diagram is utterly transformed and exhibits protected MZMs in around half of the parameter space.},
